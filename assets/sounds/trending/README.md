# Trending Sounds

Drop MP3, WAV, or M4A audio files into this folder.
The video generator will randomly pick one for each video.

## How to add sounds

1. Download trending/popular music clips (8-15 seconds is ideal)
2. Save them as `.mp3`, `.wav`, or `.m4a` files in this folder
3. They will automatically be used in the next video generation batch

## Tips

- Keep files short (8-15 seconds) — they get cropped to match video length
- Variety is good — the system picks randomly for each video
- If this folder is empty, it falls back to `teamwork_trend.mp3`
